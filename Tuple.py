# Tuple => it is ordered, immutable, heterogeneous collection of ellements and duplicates are allowed.
# tuple is comma seperated. values within () paranthesis.
# var_name = (v1,v2,v3...)
# ordered -> ordered mens print the sequence throw
# immutable -> not changable
# heterogeneous -> all type data stored on tuple -> str, int, boolen, list
# homogenuous -> only one type of data stored on tuple.

# how to access elements from tuple by using indexig and slicing

# Difference between list And tuple
# tuple is used only not changable values.
